# Sorting-Algorithm-Comparison-Project
A project in C that can help user understand about the different sorting algorithms. Also it shows all the traits of different sorting techniques.

Features:
1. Custom built separate libraries to use for different sorting techniques
2. Custom Size Array can be selected.
3. Different Sorting Algorithms available for more deep analysis
4. Comparison chart between the sorting algorithms

Analysis:
1. Time Complexity
2. Space Complexity
3. Time Taken to sort
4. Stable or Not
5. No. of inversions / swaps
