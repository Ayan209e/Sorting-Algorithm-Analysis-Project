**Custom Sorting Algorithm Libraries and Analysis Tool.**

Welcome to the Custom Sorting Algorithm project in C! This project provides a set of custom-built sorting algorithm libraries along with a tool to help you analyze and compare different sorting techniques. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this project aims to enhance your understanding of sorting algorithms and their performance characteristics.

Introduction
Sorting algorithms play a crucial role in computer science and programming. They are used to rearrange elements in a specific order, which is a fundamental operation in various applications. This project aims to provide you with a hands-on experience of working with different sorting algorithms and analyzing their performance in various scenarios.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the project using your preferred C compiler.
4. Run the executable to access the analysis tool and sorting algorithm demos.
5. Available Sorting Algorithms

This project currently provides implementations for the following sorting algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in a separate library, making it easy to understand and compare their individual implementations.

Analysis Tool
The analysis tool included in this project allows you to:
1. Generate random arrays / datasets of varying sizes for testing.
2. Apply different sorting algorithms to these datasets.
3. Measure and compare the execution time of each sorting algorithm.
