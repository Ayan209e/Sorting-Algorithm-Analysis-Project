# Sorting-Algorithm-Comparison-Project
A project in C that can help user understand about the different sorting algorithms. Also it shows all the traits of different sorting techniques.

Features:
1. Custom Size Array can be selected.
2. Different Sorting Algorithms available for more deep analysis
3. Comparison chart between the sorting algorithms

Analysis:
1. Time Complexity
2. Space Complexity
3. Time Taken to sort
4. Stable or Not
5. No. of inversions / swaps
